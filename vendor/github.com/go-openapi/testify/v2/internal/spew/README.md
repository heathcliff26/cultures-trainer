# internal/spew

This is an internalized and modernized copy of [github.com/davecgh/go-spew](https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew), a deep pretty printer for Go data structures.

## Original Source

go-spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in debugging, providing features like pointer dereferencing, circular reference detection, custom Stringer/error interface handling, and hexdump-style byte array output.

## Why Internalized

This fork of testify maintains **zero external dependencies** for the core assertion packages. By internalizing go-spew, we eliminate the external dependency while gaining full control over the code to apply modernizations aligned with our go1.24 target.

## Modernizations Applied

This internalized copy has been modernized from the original go-spew codebase with the following changes:

### Go Language Features (Go 1.18+)

- **Type aliases:** Replaced `interface{}` with `any` throughout
- **Modern build tags:** Updated from `// +build` to `//go:build` format
- **Range iteration:** Used `for i := range n` instead of `for i := 0; i < n; i++`
- **reflect.TypeFor:** Replaced `reflect.TypeOf(T(0))` with `reflect.TypeFor[T]()`
- **Standard library improvements:** Used `strings.ReplaceAll()` instead of `strings.Replace(..., -1)`

### Code Quality

- **Linting compliance:** Added linting directives (`//nolint`) with explanations where appropriate
- **Test improvements:** Added `t.Helper()` calls in test helper functions
- **Modern idioms:** Used `slices.Contains()` instead of manual loops
- **String building:** Used `strings.Builder` for efficient string concatenation
- **Code organization:** Improved struct field ordering and switch statement structure with explicit `fallthrough` comments

### Documentation

- **Markdown formatting:** Updated documentation comments to use modern markdown headings (`#`) and list formats (`-`)
- **Comment punctuation:** Standardized comment punctuation and formatting
- **Clarity improvements:** Fixed typos and improved readability

### File Organization

- **Test data relocation:** Moved `testdata/` to `testsrc/` with proper documentation

## Notable Functional Enhancements

The internalized copy maintains API compatibility with the original while incorporating targeted improvements:

- **Deterministic map sorting:** The `SpewKeys` configuration option enables sorted map key output for consistent diffs (relevant for testify's assertion output)
- **time.Time rendering:** Enhanced handling of `time.Time` values in nested structures (applied from stretchr/testify#1829)

## Future Enhancements

As an internalized dependency, this copy can receive targeted fixes and improvements that benefit testify's use case:

- **Planned:** Proper fix for panic on unexported struct keys in maps (stretchr/testify#1816)
- **Planned:** Additional optimizations for deterministic diff generation (stretchr/testify#1822)

These enhancements would be difficult to incorporate if go-spew remained an external dependency.

## Maintenance

This internalized copy is maintained as part of github.com/go-openapi/testify/v2 and follows the same Go version requirements (currently go1.24). It does not track upstream go-spew releases, as it has diverged through modernization.
